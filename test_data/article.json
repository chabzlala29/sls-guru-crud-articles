  "description":"I'm not actually started with NodeJS developing web applications, I'm more of a Ruby developer, fortunately Ruby 2.7 is supported by AWS Lambda does learning Serverless Framework is favorable on my end. I also worked on a simple PDF Generator Lambda function created via NodeJS with the help of Knex module to communicate with our existing RDS DB."
